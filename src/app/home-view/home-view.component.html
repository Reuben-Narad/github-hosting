        <p class="ls ls1">I love mazes. You don’t traverse a maze with directions, but with decisions. A location isn’t represented by an (x,y) coordinate, but by the series of decisions taken to get there. This paradigm of thinking about location has always tickled me, and it extends far beyond mazes.</p>
        <p class="ls ls2">There are two ways to describe any location: where you are, and how you got there. A home can be located with coordinates, or with directions. A file’s location can be described by its memory address, but it can also be described with its path. These two methods of describing location extend to most things in most states, and people are no exception. You can be a mechanical engineer who lives in Delaware, or you can be Johnathan who studied engineering and moved to Delaware. When it comes to describing a person, I find the path much more interesting than the place.</p> 
        <p class="ls ls3">I’ll use this theme to describe my college experience. Throughout my four years at the University of Washington, I’ve made a series of out-there decisions that hammered me into the musical yuppy you see today. The decision to move in with 12 friends snowballed into hosting concerts and raising $20,000 for musicians. The decision to work at a summer camp snowballed into becoming a fire juggling performer. The decision to follow a study abroad instagram account led me to playing guitar in a wine bar in Rome.</p>
        <p class="ls ls4">Life is a maze. You don’t know where each decision will take you, but it’s your power to decide. That’s what it means to be human. </p>
